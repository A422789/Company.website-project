# Responsive Company Website using Bootstrap

This project is a fully responsive, modern landing page for a fictional construction/real estate company, built from the ground up using the **Bootstrap 5** framework and custom CSS. It serves as a complete, single-page showcase of the company's services, portfolio, team, and contact information.

## 🌟 About The Project

The goal of this project was to create a professional and visually appealing website for a business, demonstrating proficiency with the Bootstrap framework. The entire layout and its components were built to ensure full responsiveness and a consistent, modern design across all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.

The website is structured as a single landing page with multiple sections, including:
*   An interactive **Carousel** for the hero section.
*   An **About Us** section.
*   A **Services** showcase.
*   A **Portfolio** gallery.
*   A **Team** display.
*   A **Contact Us** form.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Learned

This project was an excellent opportunity to master the Bootstrap framework and advanced CSS techniques. Key skills I developed include:

*   **Bootstrap Grid System:** Gained deep, hands-on experience using Bootstrap's powerful grid system (`container`, `row`, `col`) to create a fluid and fully responsive layout that adapts perfectly to any screen size.
*   **Bootstrap Components:** Learned to effectively implement and customize various pre-built Bootstrap components, such as the **Navbar** (with collapse functionality), **Carousel** (for the header), and **Cards** (for services, portfolio, and team sections).
*   **Advanced CSS & Responsiveness:** Wrote extensive custom CSS to override and enhance Bootstrap's default styles, using **Media Queries** to handle specific design adjustments for tablets and mobile devices, ensuring a polished look on every screen.
*   **UI/UX Design:** Focused on creating a clean and intuitive user experience with clear calls-to-action and a logical flow between sections.
*   **Dependency Management:** Utilized external libraries like **Font Awesome** for icons and **Google Fonts** for custom typography, linking them via a CDN.
